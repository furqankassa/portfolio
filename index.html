            <h2> About Me </h2>
            <p> My name's Furqan Kassa. I'm a third year UWB student who's studying Computer Science and Software Engineering with a minor in Mathematics. I chose to major in Computer Science because web 
            development happened to be one of my main passions! I enjoying learning about how the layout of websites are created and the decisions behind how to make websites interactive to the user. 
            Although I'm interested in wev development, I'm still open to other path's within the Computer Science field. If I'm not busy debugging programs, some of my favorite hobbies include playing 
            soccer, watching anime and hanging out with friends. </p>
